# MediTutor AI - Clinical Diagnosis Training Platform

## Overview

MediTutor AI is an educational web application designed to help medical students and professionals master clinical diagnosis skills. The platform presents simulated patient cases where users can interact with AI-generated patient responses, practice diagnostic reasoning, and receive feedback on their performance.

The application uses a case-based learning approach where users work through clinical scenarios, ask questions to virtual patients, and submit diagnoses. Progress is tracked locally with statistics on completed cases, accuracy rates, and learning streaks.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (Vite-based build system)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support and custom animations
- **State Management**: Local storage for user progress persistence
- **Design Pattern**: Component-based architecture with a landing page and interactive case interface

The frontend tracks user progress including:
- Completed cases with results (correct/partial/wrong)
- Case attempts with scoring
- User statistics (total completed, accuracy breakdown)
- Learning streaks based on daily activity

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Python with FastAPI (inferred from `backend/main.py` references)
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini) for patient response generation
- **Pattern**: RESTful API endpoints for patient message interactions

The backend handles:
- Patient message endpoint (`/patient_message`) for AI-powered responses
- Integration with Google's GenAI client for natural language generation
- Retry logic using the `tenacity` library for handling API rate limits

### Data Storage
- **Client-side**: Browser localStorage for user progress and statistics
- **Storage Keys**: Prefixed with `caselab_` namespace for completed cases, attempts, stats, and streaks
- **No server-side database currently implemented** - user data is browser-local only

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: Primary AI provider for generating realistic patient responses in clinical scenarios
  - Uses the `google-genai` Python SDK
  - Subject to quota limits (429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors observed)
  - Implements retry logic with configurable delays

### Frontend CDN Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS**: Loaded via CDN for utility-first styling
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography

### Python Packages (Backend)
- `google-genai`: Google's Generative AI client library
- `tenacity`: Retry library for handling transient API failures
- FastAPI ecosystem (uvicorn, pydantic) for API serving

### Known Considerations
- API quota management is critical - the application can hit rate limits during heavy usage
- Error handling should gracefully inform users when AI services are temporarily unavailable
- Consider implementing fallback responses or caching for common patient interactions
