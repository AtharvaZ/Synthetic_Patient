These are gold for your simulator because they require good questioning:

Chest pain → MI vs GERD vs anxiety vs costochondritis

Shortness of breath → asthma vs pneumonia vs anxiety vs PE

Abdominal pain → appendicitis vs gastroenteritis vs renal colic

Headache → migraine vs tension vs SAH

Dizziness → vertigo vs orthostatic vs hypoglycemia

Fever → viral vs bacterial vs UTI
